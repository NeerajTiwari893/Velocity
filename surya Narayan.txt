How was the  IT atmosphere back then, and what were the challenges in IT education during that time?
The first so called institute came to  teach IT was NIIT.
None of engineering college  really had anything on IT, there was   no specialization on computer it was either  electrical , electronic, telecommunication , instrumentation and chemical.
Nobody ever talked the word about computer science or IT as  specialization.






How did he feel when he left corporation bank was it an emotionally difficult to move on to another company when he has Spent such a long time of your life with them?


Training 20 years in organization culture was always bit painful.
It was not easy but some time you have to make decision
He was in banking IT , moved to banking IT.
Fortunately  and unfortunately some other seniors were also there working  with second  job also so it was sort of continuity in a different environment, different challenges.
Fundamentally missed friends in the office, missed the culture, place changes in first six months.
He was a front office banker with an exposure to IT .
